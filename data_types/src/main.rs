    // Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, to designate the type. Number literals can also use _ as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if you had specified 1000.

    // The Character Type
    // we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. 
    // Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.

    //COMPOUND TYPES
    // Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
    
    //TUPLE
    // A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    // This is called destructuring,
    let (_x, y, _z) = tup;
    // We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index 
    println!("The value of y is: {}, x is:{}", y, tup.0);

    // The tuple without any values, (), is a special type that has only one value, also written (). The type is called the unit type and the value is called the unit value. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donâ€™t return any other value.

    //ARRAY TYPE
    // Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
    // arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

    let _a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let _months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
    
    //type i32, with len 5
    let _a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    // You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element
    let a = [3; 5];//let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];

    // You can access elements of an array using indexing
    let _first = a[0];
    let _second = a[1];
